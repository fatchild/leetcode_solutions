# Problem: 45. Jump Game

## Approach

> solution_1

This initial approach is another greedy algorithm. It makes the best decision based on the current state. It does not look ahead and does not look backwards. It assumes that there is always a path, and from this tries to find the shortest possible path. This is impressive with a greedy algorithm, to me at least.

### Complexity

> Time: O(n) 
> Space: O(1) 

## Outcome

- Runtime `0ms` beats 100%
- Memory `7.82.MB` beats 64.28%
- Time `01:20:00`

## Approach

> solution_2

I saw that people were submitting DP answers. Dynamic programming answers. Dynamic Programming is an approach were you break down problems into sub problems in order to be more efficient than a normal recursive brute force approach.

This approach will use the memoization method. By doing so you optimize the time complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$.

### Complexity

> Time: O() 
> Space: O() 

## Outcome

- Runtime `0ms` beats 100%
- Memory `8.98.MB` beats 70.67%
- Time `00:20:00`

## Approach

> solution_3



### Complexity

> Time: O( ) 
> Space: O( ) 

## Outcome

- Runtime `0ms` beats 100%
- Memory `8.83MB` beats 84.04%
- Time `00:10:00`
